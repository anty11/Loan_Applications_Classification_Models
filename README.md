# Loan_Applications_Classification_Models
The goal is to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.  We work with a historical dataset from previous loan applications, pre-process the data, and apply different classification algorithm to it.  We use k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.
